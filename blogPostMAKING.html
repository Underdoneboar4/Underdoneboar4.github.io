    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">&nbsp;Requirements:</h3>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Clean, intuitive navigation: I decided to adopt a "importance first, chronological second" approach to navigation, where I list the items I feel are more important first, then sorted chronologically. This mirrors what I would want potential employers to view on my portfolio, with my most "marketable" items first but still with some allowance for development over time.


        <br><br>
        intentional color choices: 
        I wanted the images to stand out most and direct the focus of the user to the projects and posts themselves rather than the home page. I stuck to the black/white/gray color scheme of the template. One of my primary values for this portfolio is trustworthiness, which is conveyed well by black text on a white background, and the color gray also can convey professionalism. An exception to this color scheme is the interaction button, which I left blue, it deserves to stand out among the content that it is next to. Blue also helps further advance the professionalism and overall calm, composed feel of the portfolio. I also made sure to choose high-contrast images so they wouldn't blend in with the page.

        <br><br>
        harmony between affordances and signifiers: 

        All of the posts on the home page are interactive, where you are able to click inside them and be directed to the page for the post. They are also segmented by a border. The text for the post also turns blue when you hover over it, indicating that the content is interactive. This is the same for the social media pages at the bottom, and the form buttons also change color when hovered over as well.

        <br><br>
        some consideration to accessibility (e.g., use of HTML header tags, alt text, etc.)
        Every blog post image has alt text and the color scheme ensures high contrast. All necessary buttons are also centered on the screen, which helps them be more identifiable. Lastly, the text size is kept relatively large, trying to strike a balance between readability and information density.

        <br><br>
        usability elements to help make content easier to digest (bulleted lists, pagination, expandable blocks, headings, etc.):
        I used headings in all the posts and kept them brief enough to be digestable without further separation. I also built the blog post and project containers on the home page to move into rows as the page window expands or shrinks. 

        <br><br>
        evidence of evolution (I started there, but I learned some stuff, and now I'm here):
        This is based off of a template that was shared, but I've been modifying it a bit to fit more with my values and themes. When making the individual blog posts, I first tried to adhere to the structure of the template, separating it out into sections. However, as I started making more posts, I realized that the individual page felt a little cluttered with all the sections and headers for the amount of content that was being made for each blog post. With this in mind, I only kept the main section of text and reference to the type of blog post at the top. I also worked with Trinity on the overall design and she gave great advice on my About Me page, which was initially just a small blurb next to my picture. 

        <br><br>
        proper attribution of others' work (especially in your reading reflections):
        I made sure to credit the work of others by linking to the original sources of all my blog posts and projects within each individual post, whether through text or a link to the orignial source. 

        <br><br>
        intentional integration of your values:
        One of my primary values for this portfolio is that of minimalism/brevity. I prefer to let my work and accomplishments speak for themselves, and I wanted to focus on letting website users be able to access my work with minimal hassle. I have expressed this through the page design, ordering on the pages, and color scheme of the website. Another value I integrated was that of honesty. I don't want this website to be a sales pitch, even though it should ideally highlight my accomplishments to a potential employer. I believe the tonality in my writing and upfront style help convey this value.
