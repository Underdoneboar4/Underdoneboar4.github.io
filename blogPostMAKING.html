        Clean, intuitive navigation: I decided to adopt a "importance first, chronological second" approach to navigation, where I list the items I feel are more important first, then sorted chronologically.


        <br><br>
        intentional color choices: 
        I wanted the images to stand out most, and have maximum contrast with minimalism. With this, I basically stuck to black and white, with some grays to mix it up a bit. I made sure to choose high-contrast images.

        <br><br>
        harmony between affordances and signifiers: 

        I made the big project larger on the page?

        <br><br>
        some consideration to accessibility (e.g., use of HTML header tags, alt text, etc.)

        <br><br>
        usability elements to help make content easier to digest (bulleted lists, pagination, expandable blocks, headings, etc.):
        I used headings in all the posts and kept them bried enough to be digestable without further separation

        <br><br>
        evidence of evolution (I started there, but I learned some stuff, and now I'm here):
        This is based off of a template that was shared, but I've been modifying it a bit to fit more with my values and themes. 

        <br><br>
        proper attribution of others' work (especially in your reading reflections):
        I made sure to credit the work of others by linking to the original sources of all my blog posts and projects within each individual post

        <br><br>
        intentional integration of your values:
        I care a lot about "not wasting people's time"
