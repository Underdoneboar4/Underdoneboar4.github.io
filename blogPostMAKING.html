        Clean, intuitive navigation: I decided to adopt a "importance first, chronological second" approach to navigation, where I list the items I feel are more important first, then sorted chronologically.


        <br><br>
        intentional color choices: 
        I wanted the images to stand out most and direct the focus of the user to the projects and posts themselves rather than the home page. With this, I basically stuck to the black/white/gray color scheme of the template. An exception to this coloring is the interaction button, which I left blue because I think it deserves to stand out among the content that it is next to. I also made sure to choose high-contrast images so they wouldn't blend in with the page.

        <br><br>
        harmony between affordances and signifiers: 

        All of the posts on the home page are interactive, where you are able to click inside them and be directed to the page for the post. They are also segmented by a border. The text for the post also turns blue when you hover over it, indicating that the content is interactive. This is the same for the social media pages at the bottom, and the form buttons also change color when hovered over as well.

        <br><br>
        some consideration to accessibility (e.g., use of HTML header tags, alt text, etc.)
        Every blog post image has alt text and the colors (or lack thereof) ensure high contrast. 

        <br><br>
        usability elements to help make content easier to digest (bulleted lists, pagination, expandable blocks, headings, etc.):
        I used headings in all the posts and kept them bried enough to be digestable without further separation

        <br><br>
        evidence of evolution (I started there, but I learned some stuff, and now I'm here):
        This is based off of a template that was shared, but I've been modifying it a bit to fit more with my values and themes. When making the individual blog posts, I first tried to adhere to the structure of the template, separating it out into sections. However, as I started making more posts, I realized that the individual page felt a little cluttered with all the sections and headers for the amount of content that was being made for each blog post. With this in mind, I only kept the main section of text and reference to the type of blog post at the top.

        <br><br>
        proper attribution of others' work (especially in your reading reflections):
        I made sure to credit the work of others by linking to the original sources of all my blog posts and projects within each individual post, whether through text or a link to the orignial source. 

        <br><br>
        intentional integration of your values:
        I care a lot about "not wasting people's time"
