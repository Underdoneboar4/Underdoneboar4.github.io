            #Reflection
            
            
            
            1. Explain what the UIUN Summit was and how the exercise proceeded. This is more of a logistical description; you will
            talk about your insights from the exercise and the details of your negotiations later. If you don't want it to sound
            too, "so I took this class, and we were required to...", you can call it an "Accessibility Workshop intended to get
            young designers thinking about UI accessibility in a new light" (or something like that).
            
            
            We recently held a UIUN Summit event, which involved people taking on the roles of representing various groups of people
            who have factors influencing how they may interact with a user interface. We started out by presenting the needs of our
            group (among other related info) and listening to presentations about the needs of other groups. Finally, we held a
            group discussion, negotiating with one another to decide what features we wanted
            
            
            2. Give some highlights of your population, what you learned they need, and your original recommendations. 
            
            The group that my partner and I represented was members of Gen Z. We found out through our research that Gen Z people
            tend to prefer speed and overall accessibility in UIs that match current cultural norms. We recommended a hard cap on
            allowable page loading times and detailed instructions surrounding aspects of the website that Gen Z users might be less
            familiar with (physical mail, voter registration, etc.).
            
            
            3. Include a narrative about how the negotiations went.
            
            The negotiations went very well for us. We found that many of our recommendations overlapped with the needs of other
            groups, and ended up forming coalitions to push through requirements that mostly meet everyone’s needs.
            
            
            4. What did you fight for?
            
            We fought for speed and accessibility for Gen Z users. Specifically, we maintained our hard cap on loading time and
            diagrams for mailing.
            
            5. How did your requirements change throughout the negotiations?
            
            They didn’t really change at all. They were pretty universally popular, and the overlap with other groups meant that
            minimal change was necessary to fulfill our requirements.
            
            6. Who were your unlikely allies? Which group(s) were hardest to convince?
            
            The group representing intellectual disabilities was an unlikely ally, we had a lot of needs in common but also had
            distinct differences that we needed to reconcile. We didn’t have any experiences with particularly hard-to-convince
            groups.
            
            7. How did it feel to prioritize some needs over others?
            
            A little sad, but logical. Especially as the amount of requirements we were able to include got smaller and smaller.
            
            8. What were your greatest takeaways from the Summit? How will you apply them to other topics?
            
            
            It helped me learn about the needs of different groups and shed light on the near-political process of resource
            allocation in design. This is very applicable in other areas, mainly spaces with group decision-making and requirement
            elicitation. The experience I got here will give me experience in dealing with other similar situations.
