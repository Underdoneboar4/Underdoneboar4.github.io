            #Reflection

            
            We recently held a UIUN Summit event, which involved people taking on the roles of representing various groups of people
            who have factors influencing how they may interact with a user interface. We started out by presenting the needs of our
            group (among other related info) and listening to presentations about the needs of other groups. Finally, we held a
            group discussion, negotiating with one another to decide what features we wanted
                <br>     
            The group that my partner and I represented was members of Gen Z. We found out through our research that Gen Z people
            tend to prefer speed and overall accessibility in UIs that match current cultural norms. We recommended a hard cap on
            allowable page loading times and detailed instructions surrounding aspects of the website that Gen Z users might be less
            familiar with (physical mail, voter registration, etc.).
                <br>
            The negotiations went very well for us. We found that many of our recommendations overlapped with the needs of other
            groups, and ended up forming coalitions to push through requirements that mostly meet everyone’s needs.
                <br>
            We fought for speed and accessibility for Gen Z users. Specifically, we maintained our hard cap on loading time and
            diagrams for mailing. This caused a little bit of friction, as some other groups had similar (but not identical) intrests.
            We eventually found common ground through some wording changes though, and proceeded as normal satisfied our requirements had been met.
                <br>
            Aside from some wording changes, our requirements didn’t really change at all over the course of the summit. They were pretty universally popular, and the overlap with other groups meant that
            minimal change was necessary to fulfill our requirements.
                <br>
            The group representing intellectual disabilities was an unlikely ally, we had a lot of needs in common but also had
            distinct differences that we needed to reconcile. We didn’t have any experiences with particularly hard-to-convince
            groups.
                <br>
            It felt a little sad to prioritize some needs over others, but it was logical and inevitable. Especially as the amount of requirements we were able to include got smaller and smaller.
                <br>
            The summit helped me learn about the needs of different groups and shed light on the near-political process of resource
            allocation in design. This is very applicable in other areas, mainly spaces with group decision-making and requirement
            elicitation. The experience I got here will give me experience in dealing with other similar situations.
